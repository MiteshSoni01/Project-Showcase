# This is a complete notebook classifying Breast Cancer Classification Using both Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

In Machine Learning I used Various Techniques to come to a Particular Model. 
Specifically, used Randomized Search CV to get the best model and its parameters.
There was some data cleaning which was required.
Apart from that, I have used Comments in necessary block of code to help you understand better.
Thank you!
